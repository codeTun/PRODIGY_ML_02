# Customer Segmentation Project

This project was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. The goal is to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm, providing insights for effective marketing strategies.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains customer data from a supermarket mall, collected through membership cards. It includes:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Annual Income**: Annual income of the customer
- **Spending Score**: Score assigned based on customer behavior and purchasing data

## Project Overview

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights through visualizations.
3. **Clustering**: Apply KMeans clustering to segment customers.
4. **Results**: Identify target customers for marketing strategies.
